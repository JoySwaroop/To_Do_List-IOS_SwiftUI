# ToDoList üìù



## What is this App All About


ToDoList is a simple and intuitive task management app built with SwiftUI. It allows users to easily add, manage, and track their daily tasks with customizable priorities.

‚Ä¢ Task Management: Add new tasks with a title and assign a priority level.

‚Ä¢ Priority Levels: Categorize tasks into Low, Medium, and High priorities, each with a distinct color for easy identification.

‚Ä¢ Task Completion: Mark tasks as complete, with a visual indicator.

‚Ä¢ Task Deletion: Easily remove tasks from the list.

‚Ä¢ User-Friendly Interface: Clean and straightforward design for efficient task organization.


## What I have learned


‚Ä¢ SwiftUI State Management: Utilized @State and @Binding properties to manage the application's state, including the list of tasks and the presentation of new task sheets.
‚Ä¢ Data Modeling: Implemented structs for Task and an enum for PriorityType to structure data effectively and make it identifiable.
‚Ä¢ User Input and Forms: Handled user input with TextField for task titles and Picker for priority selection.
‚Ä¢ Navigation and Sheets: Implemented NavigationStack for app navigation and presented AssignTaskView as a sheet for adding new tasks.
‚Ä¢ List Management: Used ForEach within a List to display tasks and implemented onDelete for swipe-to-delete functionality.
‚Ä¢ Alerts and Validation: Implemented input validation for task titles and displayed alerts to provide user feedback for invalid entries.
